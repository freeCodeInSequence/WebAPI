	Websites
So website will communicate with the database 

	iOS
The iOS Application will communitate with the databeae

	Android

Avoid business logic duplication 
Extend application functionality
Abstraction
Security

Duplicate logic for each application.
Error prone code(Business logic is written in each application.)
Some fornt end frameworks can not communicate with the database directly.
Hard to Maintain.
